# Titanic-Dataset-Survival-Prediction
My first Machine Learning Project !!!! 

This dataset is from the Kaggle competition on machine learning
https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic

Performed EDA and used Logistic regression model to perform the predictions.
Workflow of the model:
Workflow--> Data--> data pre processing--> Data Analysis--> Train Test Split-->Logistic Regression model
--> Prediction and accuracy of the model--> Prediction System
